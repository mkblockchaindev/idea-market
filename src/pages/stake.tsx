      As Ideamarket is on the Arbitrum layer 2 network, you’ll need to bridge ETH from Ethereum L1 to Arbitrum to be able to buy listing tokens, or to create new on-chain listings.
      Bridge ETH here: https://bridge.arbitrum.io

We will gradually introduce more governance features into the Ideamarket ecosystem, beginning with Snapshot governance and a multisig. In upcoming products, $IMO will be used to pay for platform-specific features.

           Strategic partnerships — 10%
           Retroactive Airdrop — 5%
           Ecosystem & Treasury — 25%

           Future rewards programs: 13%

           All $IMO allocated to Ideamarket team members are subject to a 2-year
           vesting schedule — a 1-year lockup, plus a 1-year linear unlock. 85% of
